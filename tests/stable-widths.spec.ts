/*
 * Live figures must not shove the things beside them.
 *
 * `tabular-nums` was already set in both places and is not the fix: it stops DIGITS jittering and
 * does nothing about a string getting longer, which is what moves a row. 9.9 MB/s to 10.2 MB/s to
 * 999.9 kB/s happens several times a second on anything downloading, and each change drags every
 * readout to its right along with it.
 *
 * Driven rather than observed: waiting for real values to vary tests whatever the swarm happened to
 * do in the window, where writing the range in tests the rule.
