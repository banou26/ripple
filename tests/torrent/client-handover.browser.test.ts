/*
 * A handle is a counter inside one libtorrent session, not a name for a torrent. `id_for_hash` hands
 * out `next_handle_id++` the first time a session meets an info hash, so what a number maps to is
 * decided by the order that session happened to meet its torrents in, and the restore loop skips
 * entries whose `started` is false. Remove one torrent and every id after it shifts by one in the
 * next engine.
 *
 * So a command carrying a handle must reach the engine that minted it or no engine at all. Delivering
 * it to the successor is not a stale no-op, it is an action on a DIFFERENT TORRENT, and `remove`
 * carries `deleteFiles`.
 *
 * These run in a browser project because the client registers window listeners as it is built.
