/**
 * The one thing `save-file.ts` needs from `@banou/ponyfill`, asserted across the boundary.
 *
 * `openSink` tries the save picker and, when it refuses, falls through to an arm that can still
 * deliver the bytes. What decides between "fall through" and "stop" is `isSaveCancelled`, which
 * matches `AbortError` alone, because that is the platform's name for the PERSON closing the dialog.
 * So the ponyfill's refusals must never wear that name, and this is what would notice if they ever
 * did: a refusal read as a cancel ends a save that could have worked and reports it as a failure.
 *
 * Ripple used to carry its own copy of the cross origin check for this. The copy is gone; the
 * contract it depended on is not, so it is pinned here rather than assumed.
