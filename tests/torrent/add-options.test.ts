/**
 * The decisions the add dialog offers, with no dialog in sight.
 *
 * Two of these carry real weight. Skipping a file is a priority of 0, which means never download,
 * and it has to be expressed per FILE so libtorrent can keep fetching a piece that straddles a
 * skipped file and a wanted one. And selecting nothing has to be caught here, because the engine
 * accepts it happily and the result looks like a stalled download rather than like a mistake.
