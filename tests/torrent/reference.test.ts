/**
 * BYTE FOR BYTE against torrents native libtorrent 2.0.13 built from the same files.
 *
 * The strongest check available, and the reason it is worth the fixture: it covers the pad
 * arithmetic, the file ordering, the file tree, the piece layers, `meta version`, the SHA-1 pieces
 * over the padded stream and the key ordering of every dictionary, all at once, against an
 * implementation that had no sight of this one. Anything wrong anywhere shows up as a diff.
 *
 * V1 IS NOT COMPARED HERE, and the reason is worth stating rather than leaving as a gap. libtorrent
 * emits a v1-only torrent in filesystem walk order and offers no way to sort without also inserting
 * pads, so there is no v1 reference in Ripple's own canonical order to compare with. The v1 encoder
 * is covered by `make-torrent.test.ts`, which round-trips everything it produces through the share
 * dialog's independent decoder.
