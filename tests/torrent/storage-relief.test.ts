/**
 * What the "Running out of room" warning offers, which is the whole point of the warning.
 *
 * The case this was written for: a person with a 2.15 GB budget, one finished 1.78 GB torrent, and
 * downloads that had stopped. They had no folder set, and the warning told them to remove a torrent.
 * Even had they found the folder control, it only starts the auto-save MIRROR, so their usage would
 * have stayed exactly where it was and gone up on the next download.
 *
 * So the failure worth pinning is not "the warning does not appear". It is the warning appearing and
 * pointing somewhere that does not help.
