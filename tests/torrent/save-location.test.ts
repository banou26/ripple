/**
 * Two locations, and the rule that they are not interchangeable.
 *
 * A download can only be written into browser storage, because libtorrent writes pieces at arbitrary
 * offsets and OPFS is the only backend that takes an in-place random write. A granted folder is
 * readable, so a finished torrent can be shared out of it, but writing there publishes by renaming a
 * swap file over the target, which is why the file reads 0 bytes for the whole download and why a
 * crash loses the lot. Hence: land in browser storage, move on completion. Same split qBittorrent
 * makes with its incomplete-torrents path, from the same constraint.
 *
 * So "where the user wants it" and "where it is" are separate facts, and most of this file is about
 * not confusing them.
