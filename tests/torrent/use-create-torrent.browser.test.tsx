/**
 * The publish path for a pick that cannot be re-opened, driven in a REAL browser against a fake
 * engine, because five separate faults in it are invisible to every other kind of test.
 *
 * A Playwright spec proves the torrent seeds and survives a reload, which is the outcome. It cannot
 * see any of these, because each is about what the page does on the way there:
 *
 *  - the bytes handed to `addTorrentFile` are TRANSFERRED, so passing `out.bytes` rather than a copy
 *    detaches the page's own view to zero length, silently, with nothing throwing. `fakeClient` here
 *    performs the transfer for real, with `structuredClone(buffer, { transfer: [buffer] })`, so the
 *    detaching is not simulated.
 *  - `saveTo` has to travel WITH the add. A `setLocation` sent after it runs FIRST, because
 *    add-torrent-file is unqueued and polls up to ten seconds for the infohash, and then finds no
 *    entry to patch. `locations` being empty is the assertion for that.
 *  - the save directory has to be RESERVED against the orphan sweep before the first byte, and
 *    released again on the failure path only.
 *  - a name the engine would rename has to decline the copy and fall back to sharing from the pick.
 *  - cancelling mid-copy has to land back at `idle`, not on a red error, which needs `AbortError` to
 *    be one of the cancellation shapes `fail()` knows.
 *
 * Every one of the five was proven by reverting its fix and watching exactly these tests go red.
 *
 * A real browser rather than the node project because the copy writes to OPFS through
 * `createWritable`, and because `File.stream()` and a transferable ArrayBuffer are the two things the
 * hazards are actually made of.
