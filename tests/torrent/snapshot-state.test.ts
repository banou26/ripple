/**
 * What a row CALLS a torrent, which is the only description of it most people ever read.
 *
 * The case this file was written for: a torrent that finished downloading showed QUEUED. Nothing was
 * wrong with the transfer, and nothing in the app said otherwise, so the row was the entire evidence
 * and it was describing the session rather than the torrent. Two ordinary paths reach it, and both
 * arrive with every byte already on disk:
 *
 *  - libtorrent parks a finished torrent past its own `active_seeds` limit. Paused, auto-managed,
 *    no error: queued in libtorrent's sense, done in the person's.
 *  - `applyViewing` idle-parks an ephemeral cache torrent the moment its last viewer leaves, which
 *    is what happens the instant somebody closes a download page or a player.
 *
 * libtorrent state_t, for the numbers below: 1 checking_files, 2 downloading_metadata,
 * 3 downloading, 4 finished, 5 seeding, 7 checking_resume_data.
