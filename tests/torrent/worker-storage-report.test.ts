/**
 * "Out of storage space" is owed on every exit from the budget pass, not just the one that worked.
 *
 * `reportSpace` used to sit on the happy path alone and there are three ways out above it: an origin
 * that cannot be measured, a delete whose effect cannot be read back, and a throw anywhere in the
 * pass. All three skipped the one call that raises the notice a player shows instead of stalling
 * with nothing on screen, and a pass that fails part way is exactly when a full origin most needs
 * saying. The answer is a `finally`, which is not a value any pure helper can return, so the worker's
 * own control flow is the subject and the worker is what this runs.
 *
 * The failure is injected the way a full origin really presents it: the library read throws. Nothing
 * guards `loadList`, and `runStorageBudget` awaits it inside the try after it has already measured
 * the origin and what the watched film owes, so the pass dies holding an honest figure: 32 MiB left
 * for a film with 1 GB still to write. That is the case the `finally` exists for.
