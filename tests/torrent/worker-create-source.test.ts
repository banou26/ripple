/**
 * Whether a created source can be re-opened travels WITH the entry, or the entry renders nowhere.
 *
 * `saveTo: 'source'` means the bytes live outside the origin and the page holds the way back to
 * them. Everything downstream trusts that: `use-torrents.ts` keeps a source entry out of the live
 * rows, the ghosts and the starting rows alike, because the waiting list is meant to carry it and
 * offer the access button. That list reads the handle the page stored, so an entry with no handle
 * falls out of it too, and an entry in NO list has no row and therefore no way to be removed. The
 * person is left with a torrent in their library that they cannot see and cannot delete.
 *
 * Reachable on the shipping Firefox path before this: a pick that cannot be re-opened whose copy
 * into browser storage does not FIT publishes exactly that entry, and "does not fit" is ordinary.
 *
 * So the page tells the worker whether it managed to keep a handle, and `started: false` is what
 * sends the entry to the ghost branch instead, where it carries its name and offers "Remove from the
 * library". The control is in the same run: an ordinary create-source must stay `started: true`, or
 * a handler that hard-coded false would pass while making every created torrent a ghost.
