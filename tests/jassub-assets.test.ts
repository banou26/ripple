/**
 * The app and the build pass have to agree on jassub's filenames, and nothing else makes them.
 *
 * jassub 2's worker cannot be copied out of node_modules: it is an ES module importing `abslink` and
 * `lfa-ponyfill` by bare specifier that spawns a nested worker of its own, so `vite.jassub.config.ts`
 * builds it. That pass names its output itself, and `src/router/embed.tsx` addresses the results by
 * fixed path, so the two are joined by a string and by nothing a compiler can see.
 *
 * Getting it wrong is silent in the worst way. The playwright rig serves the build with `serve -s`,
 * which rewrites a missing path to index.html with a 200 and `text/html`, so a renamed asset comes
 * back as HTML rather than a 404 and jassub fails somewhere inside a worker with an error that names
 * no file. The build pass has its own floor-size guard for whether the files exist; this is the other
 * half, that they are the ones the app will ask for.
 *
 * Read through vite with `?raw` rather than `node:fs`, for the reason `lanes.test.ts` records: this
 * runs in the `unit` project, whose config applies `vite-plugin-node-stdlib-browser`, and importing
 * `node:fs` there dies resolving `punycode`.
