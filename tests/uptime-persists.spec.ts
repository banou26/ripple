/*
 * Run time survives a reload.
 *
 * libtorrent counts `active_duration` and `seeding_duration` itself and writes them into resume data,
 * so this looks like it should already work and does not. A finished torrent's resume blob is written
 * ONCE, because the periodic saver in worker.ts is `state === 3`, downloading, so the number that
 * comes back is whatever it was a few seconds after that torrent finished. A torrent created from the
 * user's own files has no blob at all by design, so its counters restart from nothing every time.
 *
 * That second case is what this drives, because it is the strongest version of the failure: with no
 * resume data anywhere, anything the reloaded page reports has to have come from Ripple's own record.
 *
 * A created torrent also seeds from the instant it exists, so the clock starts without a swarm, a
 * transfer or a network. Headless.
