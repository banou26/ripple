/**
 * Every Playwright spec belongs to a lane, and this is what stops one going quiet.
 *
 * The rot this exists to prevent already happened. `test:e2e` was a hand-written list of paths, ten
 * of the twenty-five spec files were named by no npm script at all, and CI ran only the unit project.
 * So four `storage-eviction` tests sat failing on `main` with nothing anywhere going red, and they
 * were found by a run nobody had asked for.
 *
 * A gate alone would not have caught that: it would have run the same hand-written list and been just
 * as blind to the files missing from it. What closes the hole is deriving the inventory from the
 * DIRECTORY and asserting the scripts cover it, so a new spec is not merely unrun, it is a failing
 * test in the fast suite until somebody decides which lane it belongs in.
 *
 * The lanes split by DEPENDENCY, not by cost. See LANES below for what each one depends on.

 *    readouts hold their width, which a runner with a different font set fails while the code is
 *    perfect. Split out after CI failed it twice on font metrics alone.
 *  - `swarm` watches a torrent actually move bytes, so it needs a headful browser and live seeders.

 *    needs those three checkouts and Xvfb, and no CI runner has them. See playwright.rig.config.ts.
