/*
 * A folder holding exactly ONE file, in every format.
 *
 * Its own spec because it is the one shape where hybrid and v2 need DIFFERENT file lists while
 * producing identical bytes, which is a combination nothing else in the suite can catch:
 *
 *  - a hybrid's file list is read straight out of the v1 `files` key, which libtorrent's creator
 *    leaves unpadded when there is one file;
 *  - a v2 torrent has no such key, so libtorrent SYNTHESIZES the list from the file tree on parse,
 *    and that path pads unconditionally.
 *
 * The metainfo is identical either way, so the byte-for-byte reference tests pass whichever rule is
 * used. The difference only appears one layer down, where reads are served BY INDEX into
 * libtorrent's parsed list. With the wrong rule the v2 arm died on arrival:
 * `hybrid storage: /source/... has 1 handles for 2 files`, an I/O error, and no progress at all.
 *
 * No network and no transfer: the torrent is complete from the moment it exists, so this is headless.
