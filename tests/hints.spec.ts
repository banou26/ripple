/*
 * The hints that replaced the native `title` attribute.
 *
 * Two properties, and both are the reason for replacing it. `title` waits about a second before the
 * browser draws it, and the browser positions it wherever it likes, which near a window edge means
 * off the edge with the text cut off. Neither is adjustable from the page.
 *
 * So both are MEASURED here rather than assumed from a prop: how long a hint takes to appear, and
 * whether the chip stays inside the window. The viewport is deliberately narrow, because a hint only
 * runs off an edge when there is an edge close enough to run off.
 *
 * Headless: this is a layout and timing measurement, not a transfer.
