/**
 * What @banou/ripple 0.0.7 shipped, and why nothing here saw it.
 *
 * The platform maps a tenant path 1:1 onto a package path, so an app that asks for
 * `/libav-worker.js` is asking the package root. Ripple asks with absolute paths because on
 * torrent.fkn.app the origin root IS build/, and every suite drives that site, where the paths are
 * correct by construction. Published from the repo root with `main: build/index.js`, all three of
 * them landed a directory too deep: https://fkn.app/app/npm:@banou/ripple reported "The download
 * engine stopped" over a 404 for `/assets/worker-SJZDGuG-.js`.
 *
 * So the package is now the BUILT SITE, and this pins the two halves of that: the manifest written
 * beside it, and the check that refuses a layout the platform could not load.
