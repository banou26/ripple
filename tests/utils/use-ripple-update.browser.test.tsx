/*
 * Which of the two things a waiting worker means, and the page's answer to each.
 *
 * A refresh that lands on a new build ADOPTS it silently: measured against two real builds, the
 * document is already running the new code by then, so asking would be asking about the build the
 * person is looking at. An update that arrives while the page sits open is the opposite case, and
 * that one gets the button, because activating there pulls the cache generation out from under code
 * that is still running.
 *
 * `navigator.serviceWorker` is replaced rather than driven: these tests run in a real Chrome on
 * localhost, so the container is genuinely there and would answer about the runner's own worker.
