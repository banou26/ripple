// Removing torrent_flags::no_verify_files once made a restored torrent come back at zero bytes.
// Needs network, so it skips itself without one. Run with `npm run test:resume`.
//
// IN THE SWARM LANE, moved there 2026-09-03, because "needs network" is the whole of what the lanes
// split on and this was sitting in the one that gates a push. It was observed passing one run and
// skipping the next on the same machine, which is what a swarm dependency looks like from inside a
// lane whose rule is "deterministic anywhere": the skip is honest, and its being invisible in a
// gate is not.
