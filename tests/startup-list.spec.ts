// The library has to be on screen before the engine exists.
//
// MEASURED, and the numbers are why this test is here. On a reload the torrent list is readable from
// IndexedDB in ONE millisecond, while `createSession` takes about 1.5 seconds. Almost none of that is
// the engine: the wasm chunk fetches in 13ms and compiles in roughly 115, and the remaining ~1.36
// SECONDS is the relay granting a listen port, which is two round trips to whatever region the tunnel
// landed in. The engine genuinely has to wait for that, because libtorrent snapshots a listen
// socket's endpoint between bind and listen and never refreshes it, so a port discovered later can
// never be announced.
//
// The library has no such excuse, and it used to wait anyway: the first row painted at 2059ms. It now
// paints at 65ms. The whole point of this file is that the second number cannot quietly become the
// first one again, so it asserts ORDER against the engine's own `ready` message rather than a
// duration, which would be a flaky thing to assert and would say nothing about the cause.
//
// Headless: this reads the DOM and worker messages, it never observes a transfer.
