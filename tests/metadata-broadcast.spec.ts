// The metadata a device learns has to be ANNOUNCED, not merely written to disk.
//
// A torrent's name, size and file list are what a second device signed into the same account shows
// instead of eight hex characters and a size of zero. They are learned by the device that has the
// torrent, the moment its layout is known, and they reach the account only through the library list
// the page broadcasts: use-cloud-backup schedules its write off that broadcast and nothing else.
//
// So a patch that writes them quietly is invisible for the whole session. The bytes are on disk and
// every local render is right, which is exactly why this is worth a test: the device that already
// knew the answer looks perfect, and the only thing that changes is the phone in someone's pocket,
// which nobody has open while they work.
//
// Headless on purpose. Nothing here waits on a swarm: the sample is added from the bundled
// sintel.torrent, and a .torrent carries its own layout, so the metadata is known at once.
