/*
 * A style that only loses when you ARRIVE from somewhere else.
 *
 * Ripple's routes carry their own emotion styles, and emotion inserts a component's rules the first
 * time it renders. So the order of the stylesheet depends on the order the pages were visited, and
 * two rules of EQUAL specificity swap winners depending on the route somebody came from.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical here. `home`'s stats panel sizes the speed graph with a bare `svg` rule
 * carrying `min-width: 120px`, which reaches every svg inside the panel including the VPN readout's
 * 13px info glyph. `vpn-stat` overrides it, and wins on a direct load only because home's rules were
 * inserted first. The download page mounts the same VPN readout with none of home's rules present,
 * so arriving from there inserts them the other way round and the glyph is laid out in a 120px box.
 *
 * Reported from the app: the info icon "becomes massive" after clicking Ripple from an embed page,
 * and is correctly sized on a refresh. Headless: this is a layout measurement.
