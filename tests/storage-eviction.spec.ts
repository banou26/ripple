// What no unit test can check: that the engine really gives up a cache torrent's bytes when the
// origin runs short, that it never gives up one someone is watching, and that it never touches a
// torrent the user added themselves.
//
// The origin is squeezed with a SPARSE OPFS write, which costs nothing to make: the quota system
// charges a file's extent, so one byte written a gigabyte in is a gigabyte charged, instantly. That
// is the same accounting that makes a barely watched episode cost its full size on disk, which is
// what the eviction budget exists to handle.
//
// READ THIS BEFORE DEBUGGING A SKIP HERE. On some origins that squeeze CANNOT LAND, and the engine
// is not at fault when it does not. Chromium reports a quota that FLOATS with usage: measured
// 2026-09-03, three 512 MiB writes raised it from 10.737 GB to 12.353 GB, by exactly what was
// written, leaving `quota - usage` at 10,737,418,240 bytes every single time. So `limit - used`
// is a constant there, the pressure the eviction budget watches for can never appear, and the
// padding loop chases a target that recedes as fast as it is approached. Firefox on the same machine
// held its quota still and gave up headroom byte for byte.
//
// Every test below that needs pressure MEASURES that through `squeezeTo` and skips with the reason,
// rather than failing. Four of them were `test.fixme` for months over exactly this. See
// storage-budget.ts, and scripts/probe-headroom.mjs for the measurement.

 * FOUR of the tests below were `test.fixme` from the day they were written until 2026-09-03, and the

 * COMPLETES and concludes there is room. Those have opposite fixes, so it was left annotated rather
 * than guessed at. It is neither. The pass completes and correctly reports room, because there IS
 * room: on Chromium the quota is a ceiling that FLOATS with usage, so `quota - usage` came back as
 * 10,737,418,240 bytes after each of three 512 MiB writes, unmoved to the byte, while the quota rose
 * by exactly what was written. `limit - used < floor` is then `10 GiB < 1 GB` however much anybody
 * pads, and the squeeze every test here depends on cannot land. Firefox on the same machine and
 * origin held its quota still and gave up headroom byte for byte.
 *
 * So the engine was right the whole time and the rig could not ask it the question. Each test now
 * MEASURES that, through `squeezeTo`, and skips with the measured reason rather than failing. Where
 * the origin does squeeze - Firefox, or a runner short of disk - they run and assert for real.
 *
 * The negative ones skip too, and that is the point rather than a concession. "The watched torrent
 * was not evicted" is true for free on an origin that was never under pressure, so the one test here
 * that was PASSING was passing for no reason: it is the same shape, and it now skips with the others
