/**
 * "This will not fit", said where the decision is made.
 *
 * The case it was written for: a browser hands this origin a budget of its own choosing, measured at
 * a flat 10 GiB on Chrome 151 with 2.8 TiB free (2026-08-30), and until now nothing said a word
 * about it until the download had already stopped part way through. The dialog is the one screen
 * where the size is known and nothing has been written yet.
 *
 * What is worth pinning here is mostly what the notice must NOT do. It must not block the add, since
 * eviction, the folder route and the persistent-storage ask can each make room, and someone who
 * knows that is not making a mistake. It must not appear for a selection that fits. It must not
 * offer a button on a browser that has already answered, which on Chromium is every browser. And a
 * caller that has no storage reading to give it must get silence rather than a guess.
