 * The two failures worth guarding are both invisible on screen: a watch link carrying a `files` set
 * the player never reads, and an empty selection compiling to an absent `files`, which the embed
 * page reads as EVERY file. Both produce a link that works and delivers the wrong thing.
 *
 * The rest is the empty state, which is new. This used to be a panel with a chip for every torrent
 * in the library; it is now a modal that asks for one it does not have, because sharing something
 * already in the library belongs on that row's own options menu rather than duplicated here.
