/**
 * The account tag, and the menu it opens.
 *
 * Nothing in this repo asserted anything about the account area before this file, which is part of
 * why the tag could sit there for months spending header width on a Disconnect button while
 * offering no way to reach the account itself.
 *
 * Two things here are worth more than the rest. The first is that pressing the tag a SECOND time
 * closes the menu: the outside-press listener runs in the capture phase, so without a carve-out for
 * the trigger the press closes and the click reopens, and the control that opens the menu can never
 * close it. That failure looks like the menu ignoring you and is invisible in a screenshot.
 *
 * The second is that nothing here is driven off `logout()` resolving. It cannot report failure (the
 * library swallows its only error) and it awaits a broker handshake with no timeout, so it can hang
 * forever. `info` going null is the only honest evidence a disconnect happened, and the toast is
 * gated so a logout in ANOTHER tab cannot make this one claim credit.
