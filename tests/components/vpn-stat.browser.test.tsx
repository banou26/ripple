/**
 * The WebVPN readout.
 *
 * It exists because of a real session spent debugging the wrong thing. Every torrent sat on
 * "Loading torrent…" with zero peers, no failed request and no page error, and the only evidence
 * anywhere was a console line and the absence of a WebSocket. Nothing on screen said the transport
 * was not up. This is that missing sentence.
 *
 * So the tests below are mostly about the OFF and RECONNECTING states, which is where the value is.
 * A readout that is only ever correct when things work would not have helped.
 *
 * It also has to survive an engine older than itself, for the reason connection-stat.browser.test
 * spells out: a deploy is not atomic, `engine-share` hands a tab state produced by whichever tab
 * owns the engine, and a stat that throws takes the whole route down with it.
