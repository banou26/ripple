/*
 * A HYBRID torrent, end to end, against the real engine.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS THE PROOF. Ripple builds the metainfo itself, and a hybrid carries two independent
 * descriptions of the same bytes: SHA-1 pieces over the padded concatenation, and a SHA-256 merkle
 * tree per file. libtorrent computes BOTH while checking, and `torrent::on_piece_verified` has a
 * branch for exactly the case where one passes and the other does not: it errors with
 * `torrent_inconsistent_hashes`, drops the whole have-set and pauses.
 *
 * So a hybrid that reaches 100 per cent and seeds is a statement about the merkle trees, the piece
 * layers, the pad arithmetic and the file ordering all at once. One wrong byte anywhere and progress
 * lands short or the row goes red.
 *
 * THE FIXTURE IS CHOSEN SO EVERY RULE RUNS, which the previous fixture did not:
 *
 *  - the piece length is set to 64 KiB, so a piece is FOUR 16 KiB blocks. At Ripple's automatic
 *    choice for a pack this small it would be 16 KiB, one block per piece, and then the merkle
 *    padding rules degenerate: the piece-level pad hash collapses into the leaf fill and a wrong
 *    implementation passes.
 *  - one file is smaller than a single block, one spans several pieces and ends unaligned, one lands
 *    exactly on a piece boundary, and one is empty. Those are the four branches of the leaf count.
 *  - the last file ends unaligned, so the trailing pad is emitted and covered.
 *
 * No network and no transfer: the torrent is complete from the moment it exists, so this is headless.
