/*
 * Creating a torrent from files on this device, end to end, against the real engine.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS THE PROOF AND NOT A SMOKE TEST. Ripple builds the metainfo itself, in JavaScript:
 * bencode, piece length, file order, and one SHA-1 per piece over the concatenation of the files.
 * Nothing in the app checks that arithmetic against the world. libtorrent does, for free, and
 * unavoidably: a torrent pointed at files already on disk answers `check()` with NEED_FULL_CHECK, so
 * the engine hashes those bytes itself and builds its have-set from the result. It reaches 100 per
 * cent and seeds only if every piece hash Ripple wrote matches the one libtorrent computes, and only
 * if the per-file handles were registered in the torrent's own file order. One byte wrong anywhere
 * and progress lands short.
 *
 * THE PICKER IS STUBBED WITH A REAL HANDLE, not with a fake object. Neither Playwright nor CDP can
 * answer `showDirectoryPicker`, so the test creates a directory in OPFS and hands that back: an OPFS
 * `FileSystemDirectoryHandle` is the same interface the picker returns, with real `entries()`,
 * `getFileHandle()` and `getFile()`. So everything under test is the shipping path; only the dialog
 * that chooses the folder is replaced.
 *
 * No network and no transfer: the torrent is complete from the moment it exists, so this is headless.
