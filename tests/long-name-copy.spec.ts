/*
 * The one name a copied pick cannot be given, measured against the real engine.
 *
 * libtorrent RENAMES a path element it will not use as written, and the copy has already written to
 * the name the torrent carries. So the engine's check looks somewhere nothing was put: measured
 * 2026-09-03 as three files on disk, two written by the copy and one empty one the engine made for
 * itself, a torrent stuck in state 3, and progress that never left zero. Nothing anywhere reports a
 * fault, because from the engine's point of view the files are simply not there yet.
 *
 * Ripple's answer is to DECLINE the copy rather than to guess at the rename rule, which is version
 * dependent and would trade a loud failure for a silent one. The torrent is still made and still
 * seeds; it seeds from the pick, for as long as the tab is open, which is what the platform can
 * promise without a copy.
 *
 * BOTH SIDES OF THE BOUNDARY ARE HERE, and that is the point of the file. A test that only shows the
 * long name being refused cannot tell a working check from one that refuses everything, and this
 * flow has two outcomes that look alike from a screenshot. So the 240 byte case has to copy and the
 * 241 byte case has to not, in the same rig, one selection apart.
 *
 * The pickers are DELETED, which puts Chromium on the same route Firefox and WebKit are always on:
 * `@banou/ponyfill` opens an `<input type="file">` where an engine has no picker, and the handle it
 * wraps around the result cannot be stored, which is the only condition anything is ever copied for.
 * Driving it needs Playwright's `filechooser` event rather than a locator, because the input is
 * created on the click and removed again after. No network and no transfer, so this is headless.
