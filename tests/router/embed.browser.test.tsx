/**
 * What /watch hands the player, measured where it lands.
 *
 * Both halves used to be wrong on screen while being perfectly well typed: the torrent readout was
 * passed as a `ReactNode` with no say in where a `ReactNode` renders, and it came out painted across
 * the middle of the picture and never hid; the filename was simply never passed, so the one line the
 * player reserves for it stayed empty. Nothing but a measurement can hold either.
 *
 * The byte pipeline is deliberately not exercised here. libav's worker is copied into `build/` by the
 * build script and is not served in a test run, and what is under test is the wiring, not playback,
 * which `@banou/media-player` covers against a real file of its own.
