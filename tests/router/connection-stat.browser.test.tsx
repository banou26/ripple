/**
 * The inbound stat, and specifically its tolerance of an engine older than itself.
 *
 * A deploy is not atomic and a browser tab is not a single version. The page can be the new build
 * while the engine chunk behind it is the one the service worker already had, and `engine-share`
 * hands a tab state produced by whichever OTHER tab owns the engine, which during a rollout is
 * routinely the old one. So this component receives a `Reachability` from a version it was not
 * compiled against, and has to render anyway.
 *
 * It did not. `listeners.some(...)` on a pre-0.3.13 payload threw
 * `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'some')`, and because a stat strip is rendered
 * inside the route, that took the entire page down to React Router's error screen. Caught on
 * torrent.fkn.app immediately after the deploy on 2026-08-16.
