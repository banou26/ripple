 * computes peers and trackers for ONE torrent at a time, so a dock that forgets to release its
 * claim leaves the engine working for a view nobody is looking at, and one that renders an answer
 * meant for the previous torrent shows a stranger's peers under this torrent's name.
 *
 * The dock is only mounted while something is selected, which is what makes an empty selection cost
 * nothing at all: the page unmounts it and the claim goes with it.
