// `autoplay()` against the real embed: the call an app makes when it needs a player to start in a
// document nobody has clicked.
//
// WHAT THIS CANNOT SHOW, and the reason it is worth writing down. The failure this API exists for is
// an autoplay REFUSAL, and this rig cannot produce one: measured 2026-09-07, the embed document
// reports `navigator.userActivation.hasBeenActive === true` under automation without anything being
// clicked, so an unmuted video autoplays here and would not for a person. playwright.config.ts also
// sets `--autoplay-policy=no-user-gesture-required` for the torrent ramp, which switches the rule off
// outright for every other spec. Two independent reasons the refusal is invisible here.
//
// So the refusal itself is pinned in @banou/media-player's unit tests, where the far side can be made
// to refuse on demand (src/lib/remote/remote.test.ts, "autoplay, for a document nobody has clicked"
// and "a player whose play() resolves without playing"). What THIS proves is the other half: that the
// call crosses to a real embed over a real frame boundary, starts the player it actually renders, and
// answers honestly about the sound.
