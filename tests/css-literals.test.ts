 * A backtick inside an emotion `css` template literal ENDS THE STRING.

 * silently swallows the rest of the file. What comes back is a parse error tens of lines below the
 * real cause, naming a semicolon:
 *
 *     Expected a semicolon or an implicit semicolon after a statement, but found none
 *
 * `vpn-stat.tsx` has carried a warning about this in its own css block for months and it was still
 * made three times in one afternoon, in three different files, twice by somebody who had just read
 * that warning. A note in one file cannot protect the others; this can.
 *
 * A unit test rather than a lint rule because this repo's eslint config is absent, so a rule would
 * be a file nothing runs. This runs with everything else.

   * very file whose comment has warned about this trap since before the guard existed. A test file
   * renders components and writes css exactly like anything else, so it can make the mistake exactly
   * like anything else, and a guard that stops at a directory boundary is a guard with a blind spot
   * nobody would think to look in.

 * Every css literal in a file, with the text that FOLLOWS its closing backtick.

 * short by a stray one ends early here too. What gives it away is not the body, which by
 * construction never contains a backtick, but what comes next: after a real close the next thing is
 * a delimiter, and after a false one it is the rest of somebody's sentence.
 *
 * THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS CHECKED THE BODY and could not fail. Injecting the exact mistake into
 * vpn-stat.tsx left all 24 tests green, because the body it extracted stopped at the stray backtick
 * and contained nothing suspicious. A checker is a claim about the checker first.

 * right way to say it. A scanner that stopped at the first backtick called that a mistake, which is
