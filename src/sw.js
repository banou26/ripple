 * Which requests this worker may answer from its cache, and the whole of it.

 *
 *  - A hashed path names its BYTES, so a hit from any build is correct by construction. There is no
 *    stale-content failure available here, only a hit or a miss.
 *  - Everything else stays on the network, which means a bad build is always replaceable by the next
 *    deploy. A worker that served the document from cache could pin somebody to a broken build with
 *    no page JavaScript left to run the update check, and nothing short of clearing site data would
 *    get them out.
 *
 * It exists because a deploy rotates these filenames and Cloudflare answers the old path with the
 * SPA fallback: 200, text/html, which the browser then runs as a module worker. Measured against
 * production, an earlier build's chunk is byte-identical to one that never existed.
