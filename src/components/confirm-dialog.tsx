// A confirmation the user cannot miss, for the actions that cannot be undone.
//
// Built on Ripple's own Modal shell rather than <dialog>.showModal(). showModal puts an element in
// the TOP LAYER, above the entire z-index system, which covered @fkn/lib's broker frame and made an
// FKN prompt raised during a confirmation impossible to answer. The shell keeps everything showModal
// was giving us (Esc, a backdrop, a focus trap, inertness behind, focus restored) and gives up only
// the one thing that was causing the problem. See components/modal.tsx.
//
// The API is a promise so a call site stays one line:
//
//   if (!await confirm({ title: 'Remove X?', ... })) return
//
// which matters because the alternative, threading pending-action state through the page, is how
// these end up half-wired to one call site and missing from the other.
