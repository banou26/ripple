/**
 * The footer's standing control for persistent storage, beside Speed, On add and Auto-save.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS BESIDE `PersistOffer`. That one is an offer inside a notice, so it appears only when
 * something is already wrong and says nothing in the states where there is nothing to ask for. This
 * one is a control: it is always present, it reports its state whether or not anything is wrong, and
 * it is where somebody goes who wants the prompt NOW rather than when a download is already too big
 * to fit. Every word still comes from `persistControl`, so the two cannot describe the same call
 * differently.
 *
 * DISABLED RATHER THAN HIDDEN in the three states that cannot raise a prompt (already persistent,
 * blocked in the browser's own settings, or asked and answered no this session). A control that
 * disappears once it has been answered sends somebody hunting through browser settings for a switch
 * that is simply already decided, and the disabled button's label is that answer.
 *
 * The one-press latch is a ref as well as state, for the reason measured in `PersistOffer`: two
 * clicks in the same tick both reach the handler, because React has not re-rendered the button as
 * disabled by the time the second arrives, so `disabled` alone would still allow a second prompt.
 *
 * No styles of its own. The footer's `.folder` group paints it, exactly as it paints the others.
