 * some other way or the feature does not exist for anyone navigating by keyboard.
 *
 * So this implements the menu pattern properly. Roving focus with the arrow keys, Home and End,
 * Escape to close and return focus to whatever opened it, and `menuitemcheckbox` /
 * `menuitemradio` with real `aria-checked` rather than a tick drawn in a span.
 *
 * `MenuSurface` is that behaviour with nothing in it. `ContextMenu` is the right-click menu, which
