/**
 * The WebVPN readout, in the shape the library strip and the download page header both use.
 *
 * Self contained on purpose. It started life inside home's stats strip, which styles every `.stat`
 * it contains, and it is now also mounted on the download page where none of those rules exist. So
 * it carries its own appearance and lets the strip's more specific rules win where they overlap:
 * dropped onto a bare page it still looks like itself, which is the whole point of moving it out.
 *
 * The state logic is in `vpn-status`, shared with the player overlay, which draws the same answer as
 * an icon in a row of icons rather than as a labelled figure.

     * swap winners depending on which page somebody arrived from. An icon that names its own size
     * cannot be caught by that whichever way round the sheet ends up.
     *
     * No backticks anywhere in this block. It sits inside a css template literal, so one would end
     * the string and the whole module stops parsing.
