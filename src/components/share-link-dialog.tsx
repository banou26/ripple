/**
 * Make a link that opens one torrent on somebody else's device.
 *
 * A modal rather than a panel that appends itself to the library, which is what this replaced. The
 * old shape pushed the list down whenever it opened, and it carried a row of chips for every torrent
 * already in the library, which put two ways to do one thing on the screen at once: sharing
 * something you already have belongs on that row, in its own options menu, next to the other things
 * you can do to it.
 *
 * So this asks for exactly one thing, a torrent it does not have yet, in the two shapes a torrent
 * arrives in: a magnet link pasted in, or a .torrent dropped or picked. Opened from a row's options
 * instead, it is handed the torrent and goes straight to the link.
 *
 * It does not add anything itself. Both inputs go back to the library's own add path, and the
 * torrent reappears here through the same claim the page-wide drop uses, so there is one way in
 * regardless of which surface caught it.
