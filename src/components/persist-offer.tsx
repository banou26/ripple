/**
 * The offer to ask the browser for persistent storage, in whichever notice is reporting the problem.
 *
 * Two surfaces can raise it: the "running out of room" notice on the home page, and the add dialog
 * when a selection is bigger than the room left. One component rather than two copies of the same
 * six lines, because the properties that matter here are exactly the ones that must not drift apart
 * between two call sites:
 *
 *  - NOTHING FIRES ON RENDER. The only `persist()` this can cause is one somebody pressed a button
 *    for. On Firefox that call raises a "Store data in persistent storage" doorhanger, and a page
 *    that raises it by appearing spends the only prompt there is with nothing on screen saying what
 *    it is for. That is what the storage poll used to do; see the note in use-storage-usage.ts.
 *  - ONE PROMPT PER PRESS, and one press. The latch is a ref as well as state, so a second click
 *    landing before anything has re-rendered is dropped rather than raising a second doorhanger for
 *    a question already on screen.
 *  - NO NUMBER IS PROMISED, because the label comes from `persistOffer` rather than from here. The
 *    same press moved the reported quota from 12 GB to 3.97 TB on Firefox (measured 2026-09-01) and
 *    bought nothing at all on Chromium, which refused it without asking anyone (2026-08-30).
 *
 * Renders NOTHING where there is nothing to ask for, so a caller can drop it in unconditionally and
 * never has to choose between a dead button and a gap.
