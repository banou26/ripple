 * Whether a newer Ripple is installed and waiting, and the one call that takes it.

 * The worker no longer calls `skipWaiting()` on install, so a new build installs quietly and sits in
 * `waiting` while every open page keeps the build it loaded with. That is what makes an update
 * something the person chooses rather than something that happens under a running download.
 *
 * ONE PRESS RELOADS EVERY TAB, and not because the pressing tab tells the others. It asks the
 * waiting worker to take over; taking over fires `controllerchange` in every client of the origin,
 * and each one reloads itself. No message passing, no tab registry, and it reaches tabs this one has
 * never heard of.
 *
 * A REFRESH TAKES THE UPDATE BY ITSELF, and the reason is the measurement below.

 * actually sends) with two real builds and a marker in the DOM: after a single refresh the document
 * is ALREADY running the new build's code, while the new worker sits in `waiting` and stays there
 * across further refreshes. So a refreshed page was showing "Update Ripple" while being the very
 * build the button offered, and no number of refreshes cleared it.
 *
 * That is what makes adopting safe HERE and nowhere else. The document, `/index.js` and `/sw.js` are
 * all revalidated by the same navigation, so a worker that installs in its wake belongs to the code
 * this page is already running. An update that turns up LATER does not: that page is running the old
 * build, and activating a worker under it deletes the cache generation its lazy chunks come from,
 * whose paths the deploy has since rotated away. That page gets the button, which is the whole
 * reason the button exists.
 *
 * Ten seconds is a slow install with room to spare. Past it the button appears instead, so the cost
 * of being wrong is one press.
