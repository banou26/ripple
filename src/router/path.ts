 * What /watch and /download accept.
 *
 * THE PATH PICKS THE PAGE: /watch is the player, /download is the download page. A `mode` parameter
 * used to do that job and is gone from both halves, written and read.
 *
 * `files` is the download page's selection (`all`, `3`, `0-4`, `0,2,5`); `fileIndex` names the
 * single file the player opens, and the download page falls back to it so that swapping /watch for
 * /download on an existing watch URL downloads what that URL was playing.
 *
 * The torrent arrives as either `m` (the packed form, see magnet-codec) or `magnet` (base64 of the
 * magnet URI, which is what README publishes and what every link written before the packed form
 * exists still carries). Both are read; only the shorter one is ever written.
 *
 * Nothing else. A link ASKS for a torrent and for files within it; it never describes them. It used
 * to carry `f`, a compressed copy of the file list for the download page to draw before metadata
 * arrived, which meant a second list that could be shown and never acted on, and on a single-file
 * release cost 38 per cent of the URL to add a file extension.
 */
/**
 * What /add accepts, which is deliberately almost nothing.
 *
 * A magnet, and optionally a name for the case where the magnet carries no `dn`. Nothing that
 * changes what happens: the page's whole job is to show a person what a stranger is proposing and
 * wait for them, so a parameter that could pre-agree to anything would defeat it.

/**
 * What the library page accepts, which is one torrent to open when it loads.
 *
 * `torrent` is an INFO HASH rather than a row id. A row id is a libtorrent handle, which is a counter
 * inside one session and names a different torrent in the next one, so a link carrying one would open
 * whatever the engine happened to assign that number to by the time somebody clicked it.
 *
 * Written by the embedded player, so a viewer watching a release inside somebody else's page has a
 * way back to the whole torrent in Ripple itself. Its magnet rides along for a tab that cannot take
 * the torrent from the player: that one offers the add dialog.
