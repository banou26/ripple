// Turning a magnet into the shortest query parameter that still names the same torrent.
//
// A share link is mostly tracker list. The infohash is 20 bytes of uniform entropy written as 40
// hex characters, and everything after it is a handful of announce URLs drawn from a very small set
// that the whole public internet copies from each other. So the two wins are unrelated: halve the
// hash by writing it as bytes, and prime a compressor with the tracker list it is about to see.
//
// Measured over a 12-entry corpus covering every magnet form ripple accepts, against the previous
// `btoa(magnet)` form: median -69%, worst case (a private tracker with a passkey and no dictionary
// hit) -42%. A five-tracker link goes from a 549-character URL to 148.
//
// Three things here are load bearing and easy to undo by accident:
//
//   1. `PARAM` names the DICTIONARY VERSION, not just the format. A preset deflate dictionary is
//      not checksummed on the raw stream, so decoding against a CHANGED dictionary of the same
//      length yields a valid, wrong magnet with no error at all (measured, not feared). The
//      dictionary must therefore never be edited in place. Changing it means a new parameter name
//      and keeping the old dictionary in the bundle to decode old links.
//   2. `LEGACY_PARAM` is permanent. README publishes `magnet=<base64 of the magnet URI>` as an open
//      contract, and the share dialog only ever writes to the clipboard, so links already pasted in
//      chats cannot be enumerated or rewritten. Decoding it is a forever obligation.
//   3. Everything here is SYNCHRONOUS. `watchHref` runs per row during a render and `embedPath` is
//      called inside a useMemo, so an async codec would mean the Watch link popping in after first
//      paint on every row. That rules out the platform CompressionStream, which is async on both
//      sides, has no dictionary parameter, and emits different bytes in different engines.

 * Order is not cosmetic: deflate spends fewer bits on nearer back-references, so the entries most
 * likely to appear belong at the END, closest to the payload. Both the percent-encoded and the
 * plain form are included because a magnet carries the former and a hand-written one the latter.
 *
 * FROZEN. Adding, removing or reordering an entry changes what an existing link decodes to. A dead
 * tracker stays listed: it costs a few bundle bytes and removing it corrupts links silently.
