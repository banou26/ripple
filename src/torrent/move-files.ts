/**
 * Carrying a torrent's files from one storage to the other.
 *
 * The copy happens HERE, in a page, and only the engine half happens in the worker. That split is
 * not arbitrary: the directory handle and the mirror that writes through it both live here, the
 * mirror already compares content rather than trusting a byte count, and doing the copy where the
 * engine is would mean a second implementation of it.
 *
 * The two directions are not symmetrical, because the storages are not.
 *
 *  - INTO a folder, the bytes have to come out of the engine, since browser storage is not readable
 *    any other way. That is exactly what the auto-save mirror does, so this reuses it whole.
 *  - OUT of a folder, both ends are plain file handles: the user's file streams straight into an
 *    OPFS file. No engine involvement, and no verification pass either, because the re-add that
 *    follows asks the storage to check, which hashes every piece against the torrent. That check is
 *    strictly stronger than anything this could do by comparing bytes to bytes.
 *
 * Neither direction deletes anything. `relocate` does that, in the worker, and only where the copy
 * being dropped is Ripple's own.
