/**
 * What someone can decide about a torrent before it starts, and what those decisions turn into.
 *
 * The dialog that shows this is OFF by default for an ordinary add, because it is friction in front
 * of the common case where the answer is "yes, all of it, now". It is always shown for a torrent
 * arriving from another site through `/add`, and that is not the same setting under a different
 * name: a link on someone else's page is a proposal from a stranger, and agreeing to it is the whole
 * point of the step.
 *
 * A torrent has to be ADDED before any of this can be asked, because a magnet carries no file list
 * and the swarm is the only place to get one. So the flow is add, wait for metadata, hold, ask, then
 * apply. Nothing is downloaded in the meantime beyond the metadata itself, since a torrent with no
 * metadata has no pieces to ask for yet.
 *
 * No DOM and no engine here, so the rules can be tested on their own.
