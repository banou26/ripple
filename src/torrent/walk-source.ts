 * Walking a picked directory into the file list a torrent is built from.
 *
 * The walk keeps a FILE HANDLE per entry, and everything downstream indexes those by their position
 * in the list rather than by path. That is not a convenience: libtorrent SANITISES path elements
 * before it reports them back, so the path in `session.files(h)` is not reliably the path that went
 * into the info dict, and resolving a read by re-walking a reported path would work for ordinary
 * names and fail for the ones that most need it. A file's index in `files` is exact, because it is
 * the order the info dict was written in.
 *
 * The rules that decide what goes IN are pure and tested. The walk itself is the part that needs a
 * disk.

 * torrent missing a file the person picked is worse than one carrying `Thumbs.db`. These three are

 * A `FileSystemFileHandle` is a way to get a FRESH `File` on every read and it survives for as long
 * as its grant does. A `File` is ONE snapshot: readable for the life of the page, and impossible to
 * re-acquire after a reload without another pick.
 *
 * Both answer the only question anything downstream actually asks, which is "give me these bytes
 * now", so the whole create path takes either. The difference shows up in exactly two places and both
 * say so where they sit: {@link changedSince} cannot see an edit through a snapshot, and nothing can
 * re-open one after a reload, which is what makes such a torrent go `missing`.
 *
 * WHY BOTH ARMS SURVIVE NOW THAT EVERY ENGINE HAS THE PICKERS. The union used to exist because half
 * the engines had no picker and handed over `File` objects from an `<input>` instead. It exists now
 * for the WORKER BOUNDARY. Where an engine has no picker, `@banou/ponyfill` wraps the input's files
 * in handles, and those wrappers deliberately refuse `structuredClone`, so they cannot cross a
 * `postMessage` any more than they can be stored. The page resolves them to the `File` behind each
 * one before posting, and this is the type that carries the result. See `use-create-torrent.ts`.
