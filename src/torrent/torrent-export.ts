 * Handing back the `.torrent` for something that arrived as a magnet.

 * There is no copy of the metadata to hand back: a magnet carries an infohash and the engine fetches
 * the rest from the swarm, so after that the info dictionary lives only inside libtorrent. The
 * wrapper exposes no way to read it out either, so this does not ask the engine at all.
 *
 * It reads the RESUME BLOB instead. `lt_torrent_save_resume_data` asks libtorrent with
 * `save_info_dict`, so every blob the worker writes carries the whole info dictionary, bencoded
 * exactly as the swarm sent it. That makes a byte-exact rebuild possible with no engine change, no
 * new wasm export and nothing to publish.

 * through UTF-8. The result would still be a valid torrent, of a different torrent, which is the
 * kind of wrong that looks completely fine until nobody can find any peers for it.
 *
 * `torrent-file.ts` computes the infohash the same way, off `infoRange`, for the same reason.
