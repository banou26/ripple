 * Whether a torrent is paused the way the USER asked for, as opposed to the two other ways libtorrent
 * reports itself paused.
 *
 * Three different things set that flag and only one of them is a pause:
 *
 *  - a CHECK waiting its turn reads paused with `autoManaged` still set (`CHECKING_STATES`);
 *  - libtorrent's own QUEUE parks whatever sits past its active limits, and a parked torrent keeps
 *    `autoManaged` set. The queue unparks it again a tick later, entirely on its own;
 *  - Ripple's pause clears auto-management first, so `paused` without `autoManaged` is the only shape
 *    that means somebody pressed the button.
 *
 * It lives here beside `CHECKING_STATES` because the same mistake is available to anything reading
 * the flag, and it has been made: a loop treating a queue park as "the pause has landed" withdraws
 * the want, and then nothing pauses the torrent when the queue starts it again. Measured through a
 * tab handover, where the failure rate went from 1 in 4 to 0 in 6 once this rule was applied.
 *
 * `use-torrents.ts` draws the same line to tell a check waiting its turn, which reads Checking, from
 * one a pause stopped, which offers Resume.
