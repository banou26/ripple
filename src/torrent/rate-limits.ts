/**
 * How fast Ripple is allowed to transfer, globally and for one torrent.
 *
 * Two independent ceilings, exactly as in qBittorrent, and they narrow rather than override: a
 * torrent gets the SMALLER of the session limit and its own. libtorrent enforces them through
 * separate limiters and states outright that a torrent can never exceed the session limit
 * (torrent_handle.hpp:1234), so a per-torrent number above the global one does nothing at all. That
 * is the one thing about this feature a user cannot see, so {@link limitNote} says it out loud.
 *
 * Three values, and all three are different:
 *
 *  - `undefined` is NEVER SET. Only per-torrent, and it is what lets a torrent follow the session
 *    limit and nothing else.
 *  - `0` is EXPLICITLY UNLIMITED. Someone ticked the box, and this torrent is not to be capped even
 *    if a default arrives later.
 *  - anything above 0 is a ceiling in bytes per second.
 *
 * Collapsing the first two is the mistake to avoid, and it is unrecoverable once written to storage.
 *
 * Nothing here reads storage or touches the engine, so the rules can be tested on their own.
 * `worker.ts` carries them out.
