/**
 * Where a torrent's files are meant to live, and where they actually are.
 *
 * Three places exist, and they are not interchangeable:
 *
 *  - `browser`, which is OPFS. The only place a download can be WRITTEN. libtorrent writes pieces at
 *    arbitrary offsets as they arrive, and OPFS is the only backend that takes an in-place random
 *    write, through a sync access handle.
 *  - `folder`, a directory the user granted. Readable, so a torrent can be shared out of it, but a
 *    write there can only go through `createWritable`, which publishes by renaming a `.crswap`
 *    sibling over the target at close.
 *  - `source`, a file or folder the person picked in order to CREATE a torrent from it. Read only in
 *    the same way `folder` is, and unlike either of the others it is not somewhere a torrent can be
 *    put: Ripple never wrote those bytes, so nothing here may copy, move or delete them. The rules
 *    that keep it still are written out one at a time below rather than left to the type, because
 *    widening the union compiles on its own and every existing `=== 'folder'` test has an else.
 *
 * MEASURED, because "you cannot download into a folder" would be too strong and is not what the
 * browser does. One long-lived writable taking random positional writes runs at 51 MB/s against the
 * sync handle's 52, so speed is not the problem. Three other things are: the target file reads 0
 * bytes for the whole download, a `.crswap` sits in the user's folder throughout, and a crash loses
 * everything since the last close because the target was never written at all. Reopening to
 * checkpoint costs a full copy of the file each time, about 1.25 ms per MiB.
 *
 * So downloads land in `browser` and move to `folder` on completion. That is not a compromise
 * invented here: it is exactly qBittorrent's "Keep incomplete torrents in" temp path, arrived at
 * from the same constraint, and it means the intended location and the current one are separate
 * facts about a torrent rather than one.
 *
 * RE-MEASURED 2026-08-30 on Chrome 151, against a real picker-granted directory, because
 * `createWritable` gained a `mode` option since the above was written and `exclusive` reads like it
 * would remove every objection in it. It does not. The conclusion is unchanged and the reasons are
 * now stronger, so do not reopen this without new evidence:
 *
 *  - **`mode: 'exclusive'` still writes a `.crswap`.** Seen twice, by the page and by a process
 *    outside the browser watching the same directory, with siloed mode as the control proving the
 *    detection works. `mode` governs LOCKING, not swap files: a second writable on an already-open
 *    file throws `NoModificationAllowedError`, and that is the whole of what it does.
 *  - **The target still reads 0 bytes mid-stream**, in both modes, which is the objection that
 *    actually made this unusable.
 *  - **Sync access handles are still OPFS only**, re-confirmed in a WORKER (the only realm that
 *    exposes them) with an OPFS handle created by the same worker on the same run as the control:
 *    `InvalidStateError: Access Handles may only be created on temporary file systems`.
 *  - **Checkpointing by reopening costs 3.48 ms per MiB** at 64 MiB and grows with file size, with
 *    `keepExistingData: false` flat at ~70 ms as the control proving the copy is real. Checkpointing
 *    a 1.4 GB episode every 64 MiB is around 50 seconds of pure copying and doubles the writes.
 *
 * What DID come back positive, and is not enough on its own: random positional writes land correctly
 * at 209 MB/s, writes past EOF zero fill exactly as OPFS does, 30 concurrent writables can be held
 * open, and a worker can write through a structured-cloned handle. Speed was never the blocker.
 *
 * Everything in this file is a decision with no IO in it, so the rules can be tested on their own.
 * `move-files.ts` carries them out.
