 * the frame destroys the browsing context that owns it, which cancels it. Measured as a four-way A/B
 * against the real worker with the same 1652 bytes under the same name: torn down immediately the
 * download NEVER appeared, with a declared Content-Length and without; given a few seconds it
 * appeared every time in both. The page still reported success either way, so the failure is silent.
 *
 * A big file hides this because the writes themselves take longer than the commit does; it is the
 * small ones, a subtitle track or a short archive, that lose the race.
