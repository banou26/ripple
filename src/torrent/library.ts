 * - `savePath` comes from the OLD entry. Bytes already written stay where they are, so a re-add
 *   must never move a torrent to a fresh directory and strand the old one.
 * - `ephemeral` is an AND, so a deliberate add clears it for good and two player adds cannot put a
 *   torrent the user claimed back into the reclaimable cache.
 * - `addedAt` keeps the earliest and `lastUsedAt` the latest, which is what each one means.
 * - `savedTo` comes from the INCOMING entry, by falling out of the spread, and that is the wanted
 *   behaviour rather than an oversight: an add is a fresh copy being downloaded into this browser,
 *   so a record saying the last copy was handed to a folder no longer describes anything.
 * - the speed ceilings come from the OLD entry unless the add carries its own. Unlike a save
 *   location, a cap does not describe the copy on disk, it describes how hard the user is willing to
 *   let this torrent work their connection, and re-adding a torrent is no reason to quietly uncap
