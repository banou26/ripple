/**
 * Reading a torrent's files back out of the folder the user granted, so it can be shared from there.
 *
 * Ripple downloads into OPFS and the auto-save mirror writes the same bytes into the user's own
 * folder, which leaves one disk holding two copies. Dropping the OPFS one is easy; the reason it
 * used to cost sharing is that libtorrent serves an upload by READING the file back, and the only
 * storage backend was OPFS. So a released torrent had nothing left to read.
 *
 * Nothing about that was a law. `StorageBackend.read` may return a promise, `onNewStorage` is handed
 * the save path, and a `FileSystemDirectoryHandle` clones into a worker, so a backend can perfectly
 * well answer a read from the user's folder. This is that backend.
 *
 * MEASURED before writing it (Chrome, 16 KiB random reads, the block size libtorrent asks for):
 *
 *   sync access handle, as OPFS uses today   184 to 194 MB/s     ~85 us per read
 *   getFile().slice().arrayBuffer()           39 to  43 MB/s    ~390 us per read
 *   the same, re-opening the File every read  40 to  48 MB/s    ~390 us per read
 *
 * About four and a half times the latency per block, and it does not matter: 40 MB/s is far above
 * anything Ripple uploads, and the fastest download it has ever managed is around 10 MB/s. The third
 * row is why this holds no `File` object between reads. Caching one bought nothing measurable, and a
 * `File` is a snapshot that throws once the file changes underneath, so keeping one would be a
 * liability for no gain.
 *
 * READ ONLY, and that is structural rather than an omission. Writing to a granted folder can only go
 * through `createWritable()`, which writes to a `.crswap` sibling and publishes by renaming over the
 * target at `close()`. There is no in-place write: `createSyncAccessHandle` on a picker-granted file
 * throws `InvalidStateError: Access Handles may only be created on temporary file systems`, measured
 * against an OPFS control that succeeded in the same worker on the same run. So a torrent backed by
 * this must never be asked to write, which means adding it with `TORRENT_FLAG.uploadMode`.
 *
 * Re-measured on Chrome 151, 2026-08-30, same result and same control. `createWritable`'s newer
 * `mode: 'exclusive'` does not change it: that option governs locking, not swap files. Full detail
 * in save-location.ts.
 *
 * IT ALSO SERVES TORRENTS THE USER CREATED, out of the file or folder they picked to make one from.
 * Same reads, same read-only rule, and one difference that decides how they are resolved: those
 * handles are kept per torrent and looked up by `fileIndex` rather than by walking a reported path.
 * `SourceLookup` below says why at length; the short version is that the granted handle IS that
 * torrent's root directory, so a path-based resolver looks for `Pack/Pack/a.mkv` and finds nothing
 * while reporting no error.
 *
 * PER-FILE routing was considered and rejected, since read and write both take a `fileIndex` and the
 * table could perfectly well be keyed on one, which would let a finished file leave OPFS while the
 * rest of a pack downloads. What stops it is that PIECES SPAN FILE BOUNDARIES: a piece straddling a
 * moved file and a downloading one has to write to both, the moved half is read only by the finding
 * above, and libtorrent stops a torrent on a single failed disk operation (see opfs-storage.ts). The
 * payoff would be bounding a pack to one file, with nothing at all for a single large file.

 * The files a created torrent was made from, one handle per file, INDEXED BY fileIndex.

 * By index and not by path, which is the single most important decision in this file. Two reasons,

 *
 *  - libtorrent SANITISES path elements before reporting them, so the path in `session.files(h)` is
 *    not reliably the path that went into the info dict. Resolving a read by re-walking a reported
 *    path therefore works for ordinary names and fails for exactly the ones that need it most.
 *  - a created torrent's granted handle IS its own root directory, while every `/native` torrent has
 *    its root as a CHILD of the granted folder. So the same path string means different things in
 *    the two cases, and a resolver shared between them looks for `Pack/Pack/a.mkv`.
 *
 * That second mistake fails by reporting success, which is what makes it worth this much comment:
 * the file is simply not found, `check()` sees no file holding bytes, answers "nothing to verify",
 * and the torrent is added with an EMPTY have-set. It has no error, its row looks healthy, and it
 * serves nothing to anybody, forever.
 *
 * A `fileIndex` cannot drift like that. It is the position in the info dict's `files` list, which is
 * the order the metainfo was written in and the order the walk produced.
