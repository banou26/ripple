/**
 * Whether this browser can grant WRITE access to a folder somebody chooses, which is a real question
 * with no platform name and the one place a window probe still belongs.
 *
 * `use-create-torrent.ts` no longer has one: `@banou/ponyfill` gives every engine the pickers, so
 * whether a PICK can be re-opened is asked of the handle it produced rather than of the window. That
 * does not carry over here, because this folder is written to. An `<input type="file">` hands over
 * copies of bytes with no route back to where they came from, so the ponyfill refuses
 * `mode: 'readwrite'` where it has no native picker, and refusing at the ask is right. What it
 * cannot do is answer the question BEFORE the ask, and a button that only reveals itself to be
 * impossible once pressed is worse than one that was never offered.
 *
 * Which is also why the frame test is here rather than at the ask: `showDirectoryPicker` EXISTS in a
 * framed tenant and is refused when called, whatever the frame's sandbox tokens, so the presence
 * probe alone would offer a control that cannot work on https://fkn.app/app/. The file input stays.
