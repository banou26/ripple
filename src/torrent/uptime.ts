/**
 * How long a torrent has been running, and how long it has been seeding, across every session.
 *
 * libtorrent counts both itself (`active_duration` and `seeding_duration`) and writes them into
 * resume data, so in principle they survive a restart on their own. In practice they do not, for two
 * reasons that are both about WHEN a blob gets written rather than about the counters:
 *
 *  - a finished or seeding torrent's resume is saved ONCE and then never again, because the periodic
 *    saver in `worker.ts` is `state === 3`, downloading. So the number that comes back is whatever it
 *    was a few seconds after that torrent finished, however many days ago.
 *  - a torrent created from the user's own files has no resume blob at all, deliberately: it holds
 *    every byte from the moment it exists and a blob could only ever be consulted in the one case it
 *    must not be, after the source moved.
 *
 * So the totals are kept in the library entry, which is written for other reasons anyway and is the
 * one record that is always there. The engine stays the source of truth for the CURRENT session and
 * this only accumulates.

 * libtorrent counts `all_time_download` and `all_time_upload` itself and writes them into resume
 * data, and they come back exactly as unreliably: a finished torrent's blob is written once and then
 * never again, so a torrent that has been seeding for a week reports whatever it had uploaded a few
 * seconds after it finished. Somebody who leaves a library seeding sees their upload total reset on
 * every reload, which is the most visible way this goes wrong.

 * seconds and the stored total already contains those 900. Adding the engine's number would count
 * them twice and the figure would roughly double on every reload. Adding the delta counts them once,
 * and does the right thing in the other case too, where the engine starts at zero.
 *
