 * built for a demuxer seeking around one file, and a download reads every byte once, in order, and
 * never twice. Caching those windows would hold a copy of the whole export in memory for nothing.
 *
 * What it does share is the viewer, and that part is not optional. A torrent added by a PAGE is
 * ephemeral, and `applyViewing` pauses an ephemeral torrent the moment it has no viewers, so until
 * `claim` is called the page sits at 0 B/s with a perfectly healthy engine underneath it. That is
 * the intended resting state: opening a link reads the torrent's file list off the network and then
 * stops, and nothing is transferred until somebody presses Download.
 *
 * The claim also decides the ORDER bytes arrive in: it puts the selected file at normal priority and
 * everything else at skip, which is what turns a rarest-first swarm into a stream that can be
 * written straight to disk. It is a BULK claim, so it gets no piece deadlines: those exist to beat a
 * playback clock and this has none, and paying for them cost 61% more traffic than the file.
