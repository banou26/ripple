/**
 * The commands whose `handle` only means anything inside the ONE session that issued it.
 *
 * A handle is not an identifier for a torrent, it is a counter inside a libtorrent session:
 * `id_for_hash` hands out `next_handle_id++` the first time it sees an info hash, so what a number
 * maps to is decided by the order that session happened to meet its torrents in. Two engines
 * restoring the same library agree only while the list and the order are identical, and neither is
 * stable across a handover: the restore loop skips entries with `started === false`, and torrents
 * added or removed during one engine's life are met in a completely different order by the next.
 * Flip one torrent off and every id after it shifts by one.
 *
 * So a command held across an engine replacement and delivered to its successor is not merely stale,
 * it can address a DIFFERENT TORRENT than the one the person clicked on, and `remove` carries
 * `deleteFiles`. The follower transport already refuses these by stamping a generation on what it
 * sends and having the leader drop anything that does not match, but a command parked in the client's
 * own gate is re-stamped with the new generation on the way out and walks straight past that guard.
 * These are therefore dropped rather than carried.
 *
 * The rest are safe to carry and MUST be: they name a torrent by info hash or carry no target at all,
 * and dropping them reintroduces the bug `gate.ts` exists to describe, where `/watch` loses the
 * `add-magnet` it issues during its own election and waits forever on metadata.
