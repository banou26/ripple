/**
 * What a user may change about one torrent, defined once and rendered twice.
 *
 * There are two surfaces onto this: a right-click menu on the row, and a dialog behind the row's
 * options button. They are different shapes for different moments, not different feature sets, and
 * the way to keep them that way is for neither to know what the options are. Both walk this list.
 *
 * Two rules run through the whole file.
 *
 * The state shown is always the ENGINE's, read from `t.flags`, never a memory of what was last
 * clicked. libtorrent refuses some combinations and drives others itself, so a control that
 * remembers its own request eventually disagrees with the torrent it claims to describe.
 *
 * A control that cannot change an outcome is not shown at all. Local peer discovery is the clearest
 * case: libtorrent has a per-torrent flag for it, and the session disables LSD outright
 * (`wrapper.cpp` `enable_lsd, false`), so a switch for it would be furniture. The same reasoning
 * keeps queue moves hidden unless the torrent is actually queued.
