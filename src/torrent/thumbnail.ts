 * The index this returns is the file's POSITION in the array it was handed, which every caller passes
 * as the torrent's whole file list so that position is the engine's own index. Filtering the array
 * before the call would renumber everything after the first gap, and the source would then name a
 * different file than the one it measured. That is the same mistake the Watch button made.
 *
 * The download page needs this because it may be fetching a SELECTION. A cover image outranks a video
 * below, and a cover the link never asked for is never downloaded, so without this the page
 * reconsiders a file with no bytes on every state tick for as long as it is open.
 *
 * It does not follow that the video then works: it needs a header libav can read out of its first
 * 512 KiB, which a file with its moov at the end does not have. This narrows the question to a file
 * the page is actually fetching; whether that file can be pictured is a separate matter.
