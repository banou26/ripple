 * The bundled demo torrent, and the directory it must be given.

 * The save path is not cosmetic and it is not the default. A `.torrent` add cannot name its own
 * directory in general, because the infohash only appears after the add, so `worker.ts` roots one at
 * the SHARED_ROOT. But eviction refuses any candidate that does not own its whole directory
 * (`ownsItsDirectory`, which requires exactly `/dl/<infoHash>`), so a torrent added at the shared
 * root is marked temporary and can then never be reclaimed by anything: the label promises something
 * the budget pass cannot deliver.
 *
 * The demo is the one `.torrent` whose infohash is known before the add, so it is the one that can
 * be handed its directory up front. Derived from the magnet rather than written twice.
