/*
 * Stamp the service worker with the build it belongs to, and the list of chunks it may cache.
 *
 * Runs at the END of `copy-html`, which is the last step of `build`, so `build/` is complete and
 * every hashed filename is known. Not a vite plugin: `copy-html` runs after `vp build` and would
 * overwrite whatever a plugin emitted.
 *
 * WHY A CONTENT HASH AND NOT THE COMMIT SHA. The build id has to change exactly when the bytes
 * change, in both directions, or the update flow lies. `__COMMIT_HASH__` fails both halves: a
 * comment-only commit produces a byte-identical build under a new sha, which would announce an
 * update that changes nothing, and vite.config.ts falls back to the literal 'main' when git is
 * unavailable, which would freeze the id for every build after that. So the id is a hash of the
 * built output, which is the thing the update is actually about.
 *
 * Every assertion below exits non-zero with its reason. A stamp that silently no-ops would ship a
 * worker that never changes, on a feature whose whole job is noticing that something changed.
