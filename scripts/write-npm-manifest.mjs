// THE PACKAGE ROOT IS THE SITE ROOT, and that is the whole point. The platform maps a tenant path
// 1:1 onto a package path (fkn-client, web/src/sources/package-files.ts: "tenant paths map 1:1 onto
// package paths"), so an app that asks for `/libav-worker.js` gets `<package>/libav-worker.js`.
// Ripple asks with absolute paths because on torrent.fkn.app the origin root IS build/, and those
// same paths have to keep meaning the same thing inside a package. Publishing the repo root instead
// puts every one of them a directory too deep: 0.0.7 shipped that way and the engine died on a 404
// for `/assets/worker-SJZDGuG-.js` (2026-09-11).
//
// Only the fields a consumer or the platform reads are carried over. No dependencies: the app is
// bundled, and unpkg installs nothing. No scripts: there is nothing to run in a built site.

// `fkn` is the app's OWNERSHIP CLAIM and the platform reads it off the PUBLISHED manifest, so it has
// to survive this filter or it never leaves the repo. The api fetches
// `registry.npmjs.org/<name>/latest` and compares `document.fkn.app` to the app id for exact
// equality; a claim filtered out here reads as absent, and the source sits `pending` for ever with
// every gate green, which is the failure this list caused before it named the field.
