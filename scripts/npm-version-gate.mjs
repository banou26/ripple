// A 404 on the version document is not proof that a number is free. npm tombstones an unpublished
// version: the document is gone, `versions` no longer carries it, and the registry still refuses the
// upload with "Cannot publish over previously published version". @banou/ripple walked into exactly
// that on 0.0.6 (2026-09-11, published 2025-03-17 and unpublished a minute later): the gate read
// 404, the whole build ran, the provenance statement was SIGNED INTO THE PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY LOG,
// and only then did the PUT come back 400. `time` is what keeps the complete history, unpublished
// numbers included, so it is the only field that can answer this before a signature is spent.
